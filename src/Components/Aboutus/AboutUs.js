        We are a team of aspiring restauranteers who bring to you our home recipes. We learnt it from our mother who inherited it from her's and the long chain continues. We stick to our roots to take you on a flavourful journey of Dark-Horse Bihari cuisines. 
  We, at Dehatiz, believe in Inclusive growth and source most of our ingredients directly from their producers thus cutting middlemen and augmenting the income of our hard working producers. 
Imbibing the culture of sustainable development, we also endeavour to use Zero plastic in our packaging materials. We strictly use bio-degradables including pottery as our bit to protect environment.
